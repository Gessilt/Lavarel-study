# MVC

With MVC we can separate the responsibilities of an application, in 3 types Modal-View-Controller. 
Must have a root directory, where it start the project, and a source code, where stay the de controller and modal.

## Controller

Receives the data from view or modal and with it, make a decision - it can be a method or just a view. It's built by the programmer.

## Core

Handles the URL, decides which controller and method should be called or executed.
